    ## 🏠 Property Valuation Assistant

    My next project focuses on building a smart tool that can **streamline the work of an RBI-registered property valuer** using machine learning and real estate data.

    ### 🎯 Objective:
    To create a predictive model that estimates the **market value of a property** based on various housing features.

    ### 🏗️ Key Features:
    - **Location Intelligence**: Leverages geo-location data and proximity to amenities like schools, hospitals, transport hubs.
    - **Structural Attributes**: Considers dimensions, age, build quality, and property type (apartment, independent house, etc.).
    - **Local Trends**: Incorporates regional price trends and historical valuation data.
    - **Valuer-Friendly Interface**: A Streamlit-based interface allowing valuers to input property details and get real-time valuation estimates.

    ### 💡 Use Case:
    - Assists **RBI-registered valuers** in generating **data-backed, consistent, and transparent valuation reports**.
    - Reduces manual effort and subjectivity in price estimation.

    🔧 This model will be trained using a curated **housing dataset** that includes key location and property attributes.
